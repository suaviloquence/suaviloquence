# I'm Max üê±

- I'm working on [`scrapelect`](https://github.com/suaviloquence/scrapelect), a domain-specific language for web scraping written in Rust
  - I'd love it if you tried it out! Check out the [user book](https://suaviloquence.github.io/scrapelect/) to get started and message me if you have any help!
- I did a [Google Summer of Code](https://blog.mcarr.one/tags/gsoc24/) project on Rust's [`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks) in Summer 2024, and I'm still a contributor to this project
- Feel free to explore my other repositories!
